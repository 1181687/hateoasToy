  Test_scenario2:
- Input data: the user select one geographical area, then select the sensor he wants to remove. Then choose (N).
- Expected result: the list of sensors is showed again.

  Test_scenario3:
- Input data: the system doesn't have any geographical areas.
- Expected result: "There are no geographical areas in the system. Please create or import some.".

  Test_scenario4:
- Input data: The user select one geographical area that doesn't have any sensor.
- Expected result: "There are no sensors in the selected geographical area. Please create or import some."

 

ASSUMPTIONS:
- There is user interaction: the application asks the user to choose one geographical area from where he will choose the sensor to remove.
- If a sensor is removed, all the data relative to that sensor will be removed too and can not be recovered anymore.

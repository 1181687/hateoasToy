DESCRIPTION: As an Administrator, I want the data related to geographical areas,
including sensors and their readings, to be persisted in a relational database,
so that this data is available whenever the application is run.

TEAM MEMBERS:
        - Developer: Gabriela Xavier
        - QA: SÃ³nia Silva

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

- given - The user (admin) wants the data related to geographical areas, including sensors and their readings, to
be persisted in a relational database, so that this data is available whenever the application is run.

- when - We can see if this user story works if, for example,
         the user chooses option "1" from Menu (Administrator),
         then option "2" (Geographical Area) and then option "9"
         (Import geographical areas and sensors from JSON or XML File).
         Then User inserts the name of the file to be imported.
         He/She then chooses the option "YES" in "Do you want to import these geographic areas and their sensors? (Y/N)".

After that, the user have access to the database, where the user can see the persistence data, on the link:

port: 8080
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:~/test2;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE

- then - If the Geographical Areas and their sensors are on the database, the persistence has been accomplished.

- but - If the Geographical Areas and their sensors aren't on the database, the persistence has not been accomplished.


TEST CRITERIA:
- All unit tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message.
-


ASSUMPTIONS:
- There is no user interaction. However, the user stories 015v2 and 020v2 must implement this new functionality.
- Both user stories need to work to have persistence.

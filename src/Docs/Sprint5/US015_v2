DESCRIPTION: As an Administrator, I want to import geographical areas and sensors from a JSON or XML file

TEAM MEMBERS: Developer - Diana Ferreira; QA - Gabriela Alves;

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

General Criteria:
- Correct Sequence and Class Diagrams.
- JavaDoc documentation in both code and tests.
- JUnit conventions in code and tests. (eg. tests should be named like this:
                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).
- All code, comments and documentation are in proper English.

Specific Criteria:
- given - The user (Admin) imports geographical areas and sensors from a XML file.
- when - The user chooses option "1" from Menu (Administrator), then option "2" (Geographical Area) and then option "9"
(Import geographical areas and sensors from JSON or XML File). Then User inserts the name of the file to be imported
(JSONfile.json or DataSet_sprint05_GA.xml). He/She then chooses the option "YES" in "Do you want to import these
geographic areas and their sensors? (Y/N)"
- then:
   * When the user inserts the name of the file the following message appears ("This is the content of the chosen file.")
with the contents of the file.
   * When he/she chooses the "Yes" option the following message appears ("The XML file was imported with success.")
- but - The following messages are displayed:

"ERROR: There's no such file with that name." - when no file or directory is found when the user inputs the name of the
file to be imported.

"The information on the file is not valid to be imported." - Data is null (a string in the place of a double or
vice versa) or the file is empty.

"The file is already imported."- when you try to import the contents of the file after that have been already imported.

"The XML file was not imported."- when the file cannot be imported.



Test Criteria:
- All unit tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message.


ASSUMPTIONS:
- Regarding sensors, only the geographical area sensors are imported (not the House sensors).
- There is User interaction: the application asks the user the location of the files to be imported.
- For user convenience the data to be imported is in the form of two DTO (Geographical Area DTO and SensorDTO)
thar are imported at the same time (in a single method) instead of importing the two referred DTO's one at a time.

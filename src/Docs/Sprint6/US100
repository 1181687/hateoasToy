(eg. tests should be named like this:                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).- All code, comments and documentation are in proper English.Specific Criteria:- given - The user (Admin) configures a House from a file.- when - The user chooses option "1" from Menu (Administrator), then option "1" (House) and then option "13"(Configure House from a file). Then User inserts the name of the file to be imported(datasets/house/json/DataSet_sprint06_House.json). He/She then chooses the option "YES" in "Do you want to configurethe House with this information? (Y/N)".- then:   * When the user inserts the name of the file the following message appears ("This is the content of the chosen file.")with the contents of said file.   * When he/she chooses the "Yes" option the following message appears ("The House was configured with success.")- but - The following messages are displayed:"ERROR: Please insert a valid format." - when the inserted file does not have a valid format (in this case .json)."ERROR: There's no such file with that name." - when no file or directory is found when the user inputs the name of thefile to be imported."Sorry! The file doesn't contain valid information. It was not possible to import it." - Data is null or doesn't havethe right format (a string in the place of a double or vice versa) or the file is empty."The House is already configured." - when you try to import the contents of the file after that have been already imported."The House was not configured." - when the file cannot be imported.Test Criteria:- All unit tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message.- When user chooses option "1" from Menu, then option "1" and then option "13", should not accept letters, symbols, orany number that's not displayed in the menu.- When He/She then chooses the option "Y" or "N" in "Do you want to configure the House with this information? (Y/N)",should not accept letters, symbols, or any number unless its a "Y" or "y" or a "N" or a "n".Acceptance Tests://FileTest_scenario1:- Input data: the path of file is not correct, so the file cannot be found.- Expected result: "ERROR: There's no such file with that name."Test_scenario2:- Input data: the path file is correct, but is empty.- Expected result: "The information on the file is not valid to be imported."Test_scenario3:- Input data: the path file is correct, but it has some or all data, already imported.- Expected result: "The House is already configured."//RoomsTest_scenario4:- Input data: Some or all rooms cannot be imported because their content (all or part of it) is not valid).Examples: invalid id, description, house floor and dimensions (width, length, height).- Expected result: "The file was partially imported/not imported. There were [numberof] rooms that were not imported,due to invalid information."//GridsTest_scenario5:- Input data: Some or all grids cannot be imported because their content (all or part of it) is not valid).Example: invalid id/name and Rooms).- Expected result: "The file was partially imported/not imported. There were [numberof] grids that were not imported, dueto invalid information."//LoggerTest_scenario6:- Input data: Some or all rooms cannot be imported because their content is not valid (in this case null id).- Expected result: The rooms are not imported, and the information in saved in log "Room was not imported because ithas a null id."Test_scenario7:- Input data: Some or all rooms cannot be imported because their content is not valid (in this case the id already exists).- Expected result: "Room was not imported because [id of the room(s)] already exists [invalid info - roomid].Test_scenario8:- Input data: Some or all rooms cannot be imported because their content is not valid (in this case id does not havevalid dimensions - width, length or height).- Expected result: "Room was not imported because [id of the room(s)] does not have valid dimensions [invalid info -dimensions].Test_scenario9:- Inut data: Some or all grids cannot be imported because their content is not valid (in this case null id).- Expected result: The grids are not imported, and the information in saved in log "Grid was not imported because it has a null id."Test_scenario10:- Input data: Some or all grids cannot be imported because their content is not valid (in this case the id already exists).- Expected result: "Grid was not imported because [id of the grid(s)] already exists [invalid info - gridid].ASSUMPTIONS:- There is User interaction: the application asks the user the location of the files to be imported.- US100 is an alternative method to US 105,130,135 and 147.

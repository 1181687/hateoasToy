DESCRIPTION: As a Power User or as a Room Owner, I want to have a list of the instants in which the temperature rose
above the comfort level in a given time interval and category (annex A.2 of EN 15251).

ASSUMPTIONS:


* USER COMFORT - EN 15251:2006 provides recommendations for acceptable indoor temperatures for design of buildings without mechanical
cooling systems. The following formulas are given in annex A.2

- Category I:  Upper limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 + 2
               Lower limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 − 2

- Category II: Upper limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 + 3
               Lower limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 − 3

- Category III: Upper limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 + 4
                Lower limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 − 4


* When this user story is executed, the user (Power User or Room Owner) chooses the category he/she wishes to associate to
the room and the math regarding the US are made considering the chosen category.

* It is assumed that "to" in the formula to calculate the temperature is the outside temperature in the house area.

* The standard EN 15251:2006 provides the formula of a weighted average of several days, and, at the least, the number
of days may be one. At this time, it is not necessary to consider the average of several days, but only the average of
the day itself.

* When supplying the user stories, it was explained that in the Standard EN 15251:2006  document there is a section
with the necessary information for the application of EN 15251. This is of course a simplification, since the standard
is quite complex. In this sprint, it is only necessary to apply what is defined in the requirements. Further on, the
PO can understand that it wants to refine the mechanism.

* A time interval can encompass several days.

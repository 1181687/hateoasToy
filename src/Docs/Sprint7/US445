ASSUMPTIONS:


USER COMFORT
EN 15251:2006 provides recommendations for acceptable indoor temperatures for design of buildings without mechanical
cooling systems. The following formulas are given in annex A.2

- Category I:  Upper limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 + 2
               Lower limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 − 2

- Category II: Upper limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 + 3
               Lower limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 − 3

- Category III: Upper limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 + 4
                Lower limit ti max = 0.33 to + 18.8 − 4


When this user story is executed, the user (Power User or Room Owner) chooses the category he/she wishes to associate to
the room and the math regarding the US are made considering the chosen category.

It is assumed that "to" in the formula to calculate the temperature is the outside temperature in the house area.

    ARCHITECTURE

- The architecture of our software is based on three layers: UI, Controller and Model.
- The UI Layer communicates with the Controller, which, in turn, communicates with the Model layer.
All data exchange between controller and UI classes will use DTOs, in order to improve application's serviceability

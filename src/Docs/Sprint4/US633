NUMBER: US633

DESCRIPTION: As a Regular User, I want to get the day with the highest temperature amplitude in the house area
in a given period.

TEAM MEMBERS: Developer - Gabriela Alves; QA - Joana Figueira;

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

General Criteria:
- All acceptance tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message.
- Correct Sequence and Class Diagrams.
- JavaDoc documentation in both code and tests.
- JUnit conventions in code and tests. (eg. tests should be named like this:
                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).
- All code, comments and documentation are in proper English.

Specific Criteria:
- given - The user wants to get the first day with the highest temperature amplitude in the house area in a given period.
- when - The user chooses option "2" from Menu (Regular User), then option "1" (House Area) and then option "5"
        (Get day with highest temperature amplitude in the housegrid area). Then User inserts the first date and then final
        date of the period he wants to consider.
- then - It is shown to the User the day with the highest temperature amplitude and its amplitude value: eg. "The highest
        temperature amplitude for the chosen period is 2.8 Celsius and was registered on: 2018-12-30".
- but - The following messages are displayed:

"That is not a valid period. Please try again." - when final date inserted is before start date
"There's no registers for this period." - when there are no valid readings for this selected period

ASSUMPTIONS:
To calculate the first day with the highest temperature, one must choose the sensor with the most recent readings if there are two
temperature sensors at the same distance from the house area.

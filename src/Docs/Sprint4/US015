ASSUMPTIONS:
- Regarding sensors, only the geographical area sensors are imported.
- There is User interaction: the application asks the user the location of the files to be imported.
- For user convenience the data to be imported is in the form of two DTO (Geographical Area DTO and SensorDTO)
thar are imported at the same time instead of importing the two referred DTO's one at a time.

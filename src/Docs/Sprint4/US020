DESCRIPTION: As an Administrator, I want to import geographical areas sensors’ readings into the application from a
CSV file. Data outside the valid sensor operation period shouldn’t be imported but registered in the application log.

TEAM MEMBERS: Developer - Luis de Almeida; QA - Gabriela Alves;

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

General Criteria:
- All acceptance tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message.
- Correct Sequence and Class Diagrams.
- JavaDoc documentation in both code and tests.
- JUnit conventions in code and tests. (eg. tests should be named like this:
                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).
- All code, comments and documentation are in proper English.

Specific Criteria:
- given - The user (Admin) imports geographical areas sensors’ readings into the application from a CSV file.
- when - The user chooses option "10" from Menu (Administrator), then option "2" (Geographical Area) and then option "10"
(Import Readings from CSV File). Then User inserts the path to the CSV file to be imported.
- then - A success message is displayed if all the sensors readings are inserted ("All readings were imported successfully").
- but - The following messages are displayed:

"No such file or directory" - when no file or directory is found when the user inputs the name of the file from where to
import the readings.
"Some readings weren't imported. Do you wish to see them." - when at least more than 80% of the readings were
successfully imported and the rest (20%) are displayed to the user if he/she chooses to see them.
"The content of the file could not be imported, because it does not meet the minimum criteria (80%) of valid readings."
- when at least more than 20% of the readings could not be successfully imported.

ASSUMPTIONS:
There is User interaction: the application asks the user the location of the files to be imported.

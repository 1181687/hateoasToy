DESCRIPTION: As an Administrator, I want to import geographical areas sensors’ readings into the application from a
CSV file. Data outside the valid sensor operation period shouldn’t be imported but registered in the application log.

TEAM MEMBERS: Developer - Luis de Almeida; QA - Gabriela Alves;

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

General Criteria:
- Correct Sequence and Class Diagrams.
- JavaDoc documentation in both code and tests.
- JUnit conventions in code and tests. (eg. tests should be named like this:
                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).
- All code, comments and documentation are in proper English.

Specific Criteria:
- given - The user (Admin) imports geographical areas sensors’ readings into the application from a CSV file.

- when - The user chooses option "10" from Menu (Administrator), then option "2" (Geographical Area) and then option "10"
(Import Readings from CSV File). Then User inserts the path to the CSV file to be imported.

- then - A success message is displayed if all the sensors readings are inserted:
Output_1: "All readings were imported successfully".


- but - Depending on the result, one of the following messages are displayed:

Output_2: "ERROR: There's no such file with that name." - if no file or directory is found when the user inputs the name of the
file from where he wants to import the readings;



//
Output_3: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)" - if some readings weren't
successfully imported.

Output_4: "The following readings weren't imported:" and shows the respective readings.- If the user chooses "Y",
 in the previous message.
//



Test Criteria:
- All unit tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message.

- Acceptance tests:

Test_scenario1:
- Input data: the path csv file is not correct, so the file can not be found
- Expected result: "ERROR: There's no such file with that name."

Test_scenario2:
- Input data: the path csv file is correct, but is empty.
- Expected result: "Error - readings weren't imported"

Test_scenario3:
- Input data: the csv file has only readings that don't have LocalDateTime format.
- Expected result: "Error - readings weren't imported"

Test_scenario4:
- Input data: the csv file has only readings that don't have double format measurements.
- Expected result: "Error - readings weren't imported"

Test_scenario5:
- Input data: the csv file has only Data outside the valid sensor operation period.
- Expected result: "Error - readings weren't imported"

Test_scenario6:
- Input data: the csv file has only readings with Sensor Id's that don´t correspond to the existing sensors.
- Expected result: "Error - readings weren't imported"

Test_scenario7:
- Input data: the csv file has some readings with Sensor Id that don´t correspond to the existing sensors.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input Y: expected result: list of the readings.

Test_scenario8:
- Input data: the csv file has some readings with Sensor Id that don´t correspond to the existing sensors.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input N: expected result: ends that functionality and show the menu again.

Test_scenario9:
- Input data: the csv file has some readings that don't have LocalDateTime format.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input Y: expected result: list of the readings.

Test_scenario10:
- Input data: the csv file has some readings that don't have LocalDateTime format.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input N: expected result: ends that functionality and show the menu again.

Test_scenario11:
- Input data: the csv file has some readings that don't have double format measurements.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input Y: expected result: list of the readings.

Test_scenario12:
- Input data: the csv file has some readings that don't have double format measurements.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input N: expected result: ends that functionality and show the menu again.

Test_scenario13:
- Input data: the csv file have some Data outside the valid sensor operation period.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input Y: expected result: list of the readings.

Test_scenario14:
- Input data: the csv file have some Data outside the valid sensor operation period.
- Expected result: "Some readings weren't imported. Do you want to see them? (Y/N)"
- Input N: expected result: ends that functionality and show the menu again.


ASSUMPTIONS:
There is User interaction: the application asks the user the location of the files to be imported.
When the systems tries to parse the String to LocalDatetTime, and is a LocalDate, the CSV line is discarded and sent
to the application log.

DESCRIPTION: As a Regular User, I want to get the last coldest day (lower maximum temperature) in the house area
in a given period.

TEAM MEMBERS: Developer - Diana Silva; QA - Gabriela Xavier;

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

General Criteria:
- Correct Sequence and Class Diagrams.
- JavaDoc documentation in both code and tests.
- JUnit conventions in code and tests. (eg. tests should be named like this:
                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).
- All code, comments and documentation are in proper English.

Specific Criteria:
- given - The user (regular user) wants to get the last coldest day (lower maximum temperature) in the house area
in a given period.
- when - The user chooses option "2" from Menu (Regular User), then option "1" (House Area) and finally the option "6"
(Last coldest day in a given period). The user should select the first and the final date of the period he/she wants to
consider.
- then - It is shown to the User the day with the last coldest day (lower maximum temperature) and the temperature value
in that day. For instance:
Output_1: "The last coldest day (lower maximum temperature) in the house area in the period between 2018-12-01 and 2018-12-31 is:
 2018-12-31 with 15.5 Celsius."
- but - Depending on the result, one of the following messages are displayed:

Output_2: "There are no valid readings in the nearest sensor for that period." - If there is no readings for the sensor in that period.
Output_3: "There are no temperature sensors in the house area." - If there's no sensors in the house area.
Output_4: "That is not a valid period. Please try again." - If the first day is after the last day of the input.
Output_5: "The last reading of the nearest sensor is not valid." - If the reading is not recognized as a reading.



Test Criteria:
- All acceptance tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message:

- Acceptance tests:

Test_scenario1:
- Input data: the sensors of the house area are nonexistent.
- Expected result: "There are no valid readings in the nearest sensor for that period."

Test_scenario2:
- Input data: the last reading of the nearest sensor is not recognized as a valis reading.
- Expected result: "The last reading of the nearest sensor is not valid."

Test_scenario3:
- Input data: the first day is after the last day of the input.
- Expected result: "That is not a valid period. Please try again."

Test_scenario4:
- Input data: the sensors of the house area aren't temperature sensors.
- Expected result: "There are no temperature sensors in the house area."




ASSUMPTIONS:
To calculate the last coldest day, one must choose the sensor with the most recent readings if there are two
temperature sensors at the same distance from the house area.

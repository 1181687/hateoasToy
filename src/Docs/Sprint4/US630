in a given period.

TEAM MEMBERS: Developer - Diana Silva; QA - Gabriela Xavier;

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

General Criteria:
- Correct Sequence and Class Diagrams.
- JavaDoc documentation in both code and tests.
- JUnit conventions in code and tests. (eg. tests should be named like this:
                                        testNameOfTheMethod_conditionThatIsBeingTested_expectedResult).

in a given period.
- when - The user chooses option "2" from Menu (Regular User), then option "1" (House Area) and finally the option "6"
(Last coldest day in a given period). The user should select the first and the final date of the period he/she wants to
consider.
- then - It is shown to the User the day with the last coldest day (lower maximum temperature) and the temperature value
in that day. For instance:
"The last coldest day (lower maximum temperature) in the house area in the period between 2018-12-01 and 2018-12-31 is:
 2018-12-31 with 15.5 Celsius."
- but -

"There are no valid readings in the nearest sensor for that period." If there is no readings for the sensor in that period.
"There are no temperature sensors in the house area." If there's no sensors in the house area.
"That is not a valid period. Please try again." If the first day is after the last day of the input.
"The last reading of the nearest sensor is not valid." If the reading is not recognized as a reading.



Test Criteria:
- All acceptance tests with "Process finished with exit code 0" message:


ASSUMPTIONS:
To calculate the last coldest day, one must choose the sensor with the most recent readings if there are two
temperature sensors at the same distance from the house area.

US623 As a Regular User, I want to get the average daily rainfall in the house area for a
given period (days), as it is needed to assess the gardenâ€™s watering needs.

US600 As a Regular User, I want to get the current temperature in the house area. If, in the
first element with temperature sensors of the hierarchy of geographical areas that
includes the house, there is more than one temperature sensor, the nearest one
should be used.
